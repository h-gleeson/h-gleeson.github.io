        <strong>Introduction:</strong> A critical study of Stonehenge not as a monument, but as a shifting cultural tool. This project traces the transformation of the site from a communal space of "hidden labor" and celestial harmony to a gentrified destination optimized for profit. By examining themes of militarization, commodification, and circadian rhythms, the research highlights the disconnect between ancient craftsmanship and modern industrialized production, urging a reconnection with the natural cycles that once defined human culture.

        <strong>Drawing 1, Militarization of The Sky:</strong> This drawing contrasts the untouched night sky of Stonehenge’s ancient era with the cluttered expanse visible today. When Stonehenge was built, the night sky served as 
an unmediated canvas, a vital tool for navigation, rituals, and understanding seasonal cycles. In that era, the stars were constant, unmarred by human interference. Today, 
the sky is overwhelmed by human-made elements—aircraft, drones, satellites, and light pollution—which obscure our view of constellations and sever our connection to the celestial bodies we once worshipped. Stonehenge’s builders likely relied on the clarity of the night for spiritual and practical purposes, while the modern world’s 
technological intrusion diminishes the night’s clarity and magic. This evolution of the night sky reflects a broader 
shift: from reverence for natural cycles to a desire for control, leaving Stonehenge’s original purpose as a cosmic and temporal guide increasingly out of reach.

    <span class="info-value" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong>Drawing 2, Gentrification:</strong> Stonehenge, once a sacred gathering place for rituals and 
community connection, now stands as a symbol of cultural commodification. The site’s evolution from a place 
of spiritual significance to a curated tourist destination 
illustrates the gentrification of heritage. Visitor centers, 
gift shops, and ticketed experiences have transformed the 
night around Stonehenge from one of cultural introspection to commercial activity. The meticulous maintenance 
and managed access strip the site of its raw, ancient 
essence, reframing it as an object of profit rather than 
reverence. This shift parallels the broader societal trend 
of commodifying spaces of significance. Stonehenge’s 
night is no longer a sanctuary for stargazers or a canvas 
for spiritual connection; instead, it’s shaped by artificial 
lighting and pathways meant to control visitors’ experiences. The gentrification of this historic site challenges 
us to consider whether modernization inherently erodes 
authenticity.

        <strong>Drawing 3, Sleep:</strong> This timeline weaves together key historical moments for 
Stonehenge with global changes in sleep patterns, revealing their intertwined narratives. Stonehenge, a monument 
to celestial alignment, likely played a role in harmonizing 
human activity with natural rhythms. Before industrialization, sleep followed segmented patterns aligned with 
cycles of light and dark—a rhythm Stonehenge itself 
may have symbolized. However, industrialization and 
modern timekeeping fractured this connection, ushering 
in the rigid schedules of today. Stonehenge now exists 
in a world where sleep, much like labor, is treated as a 
commodity, subject to efficiency and control. The timeline in this drawing underscores the irony: Stonehenge, 
once a marker of organic time, now sits within a society 
disconnected from those rhythms. The shifts in sleep 
patterns not only reflect changing labor demands but also 
highlight the loss of ancient practices that once celebrated 
human alignment with the natural world.

        <strong>Drawing 4, Sleep:</strong> This drawing examines the origins of Stonehenge’s 
megaliths and compares them to the materials used in its 
modern visitor center, highlighting the transformation of 
labor practices over time. The construction of Stonehenge 
required immense collective effort, with stones transported over vast distances through methods that remain partially mysterious. This communal labor connected people 
directly to the land and to one another. In contrast, the 
visitor center represents modern labor systems defined by 
industrialization and global supply chains. Its materials 
are sourced for efficiency and profit, often detached from 
their environmental and cultural origins. The section 
drawing juxtaposes the longevity of Stonehenge’s materials with the disposable, less renewable nature of the 
visitor center, critiquing the impermanence of contemporary construction practices. By examining this contrast, 
the drawing invites reflection on how labor has evolved 
from being a shared cultural endeavor to an increasingly 
exploitative and disconnected process.
